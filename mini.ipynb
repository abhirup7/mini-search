       " 'text': 'Later that year, YouTube came under criticism for showing inappropriate videos targeted at children and often featuring popular characters in violent, sexual or otherwise disturbing situations, many of which appeared on YouTube Kids and attracted millions of views. The term \"Elsagate\" was coined on the Internet and then used by various news outlets to refer to this controversy. On November 11, 2017, YouTube announced it was strengthening site security to protect children from unsuitable content. Later that month, the company started to mass delete videos and channels that made improper use of family-friendly characters. As part of a broader concern regarding child safety on YouTube, the wave of deletions also targeted channels that showed children taking part in inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults. Most notably, the company removed \"Toy Freaks\", a channel with over 8.5\\xa0million subscribers, that featured a father and his two daughters in odd and upsetting situations. According to analytics specialist SocialBlade, it earned up to £8.7\\xa0million annually prior to its deletion.',\n",

    "✅ **Custom HNSW Implementation Works!** \n",
    "- Successfully built pure Python HNSW algorithm with cosine similarity\n",
    "- Achieved 1.7x speedup over brute force on 10k vectors\n",
    "- Algorithm correctly navigates the hierarchical graph structure\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Trade-offs Observed:**\n",
    "- Build time: ~5 minutes for 10k vectors (vs instantaneous for brute force)\n",
    "- Memory overhead: Graph connections require additional storage\n",
    "- Pure Python implementation limits performance vs optimized libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Each Method Excels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom HNSW:**\n",
    "- Best for: Many queries on same dataset, approximate search acceptable\n",
    "- Use when: You need to understand/modify the algorithm, educational purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brute Force:**\n",
    "- Best for: Small datasets, one-off queries, exact results required\n",
    "- Use when: Dataset < 1k vectors, maximum accuracy needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**FAISS (if working):**\n",
    "- Best for: Production systems, massive datasets, optimal performance\n",
    "- Use when: Scaling to millions of vectors, minimal latency requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps for Production Search Index\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use FAISS/Weaviate/Pinecone** for production workloads\n",
    "2. **Add pre-filtering** for metadata-based search\n",
    "3. **Implement hybrid search** (dense + sparse vectors)\n",
    "4. **Add reranking** with cross-encoders for better relevance"
